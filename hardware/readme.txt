This folder contains the Hardware schematic diagram and related info.

I designed the new CarbOnBal Basic using a proper tool "KiCad" instead of the awful Fritzing software I drew the first version with. 
The parts were painstakingly drawn in an unconventional but very beginner-friendly manner that makes it a cynch to wire up the real world components with little risk of making a serious mistake. Don't take my word for it, check out the PDF. I'll upload the KiCad sources when I figure out how to clean them up for distribuation! 

The control panel SVG file is meant as a starting point for your own design. Feel free to copy it but know that it is a rough prototype and the screw holes were drilled without measuring first. You have een warned!
